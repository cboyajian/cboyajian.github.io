      "contents": "\r\nClarissa is an ISA Certified Arborist with a focus on urban forestry nonprofit\r\nmanagement in Los Angeles. She has a master of Environmental Data Science from\r\nthe Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara and a\r\nB.A. in Urban and Environmental Policy from Occidental College. As a child,\r\nshe heard stories of her grandparents’ fight to save a beloved Ginkgo tree;\r\nthis was the seed of her interest in the connection between people and place.\r\nShe pivoted her career to urban forestry in 2015, training volunteers to plan\r\nand execute tree planting and care projects within their own communities. She\r\nthen shifted to managing the environmental services department of a nonprofit,\r\nwhere she focused on staff development and budgets, wrote successful state\r\ngrants, and expanded partnerships with the city and other local nonprofits.\r\nAfter expanding her technical skills at the Bren School, she worked at an\r\nenvironmental consulting firm where she supported municipalities and\r\ncounties in analyzing and visualizing data related to their urban forest with\r\nan emphasis on equity. She is now a technical expert for the City of LA Public\r\nWorks’ Office of Forest Management - focusing on creating the City’s first\r\nUrban Forest Management Plan, canopy equity, and tree preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
