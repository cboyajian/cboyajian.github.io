She has a master of Environmental\nData Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science &\nManagement at UC Santa Barbara and a B.A. in Urban and Environmental\nPolicy from Occidental College. As a child, she heard stories of her\ngrandparents’ fight to save a beloved Ginkgo tree; this was the seed of\nher interest in the connection between people and place. She pivoted her\ncareer to urban forestry in 2016, training volunteers to plan and\nexecute tree planting and care projects within their own communities.\nShe then shifted to managing the environmental services department of a\nnonprofit, where she focused on staff development and budgets, wrote\nsuccessful state grants, and expanded partnerships with the city and\nother local nonprofits. She now combines her urban forestry professional\nexperience with her data science training to support cities and counties\nto analyze and visualize data related to their urban forest and\nequity.\n\n\n\n",
