      "contents": "\nI am an ISA Certified Arborist with specific experience in urban forestry in Southern California. I studied Urban and Environmental Policy at Occidental College and am currently a master’s candidate of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I began my urban forestry career in 2016, training volunteers to plan and execute tree planting and care projects within their own neighborhoods. I then managed the environmental services department of a direct service nonprofit where I focused on staff management and unit budgets, wrote successful state grants, and worked with the city and local nonprofits. I hope to use my data science degree to bring more analysis and technical support to the field of urban forestry. As a child, I heard stories of my grandparents’ struggle to save a beloved Ginkgo tree. This was the seed of my interested in the connection between people and place. My career goal is to work collaboratively to create equitable connection between people and the built and wild environments.\n\n\n\n",
