    "contents": "\r\nThis blog post was written with Halina Do-Lihn and a version of it was originally posted on the Bren School’s Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) community blog. The Bren School of Environmental Science & Management houses two professional master’s programs and a PhD program at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\r\nMEDS Capstone Project 101\r\nThe MEDS capstone project is a collaborative team experience where students use data to design, develop, and share a deliverable to help a client address an environmental issue. For the 2021-2022 academic year, all clients for capstone projects are UCSB affiliated, but in future years anyone will be able to propose a project! Projects that are chosen by the Capstone Committee get a team of 3-4 students from January to June 2022 (roughly 1 full-time staff for 6-months). All projects need to be product-oriented, have access to necessary data, be fully funded, have an environmental justice aspect, and have a clearly defined scope. Check out more in the timeline below!\r\n\r\nOur proposal and capstone\r\nWe are co-authors on the proposal, Ensuring equitable access to outdoor recreation: Evaluating spatiotemporal patterns and trends in campground use on federal public lands. Our project will combine data from the Recreation Information Database (RIDB) and U.S. Census Data to create an online tool that visually represents our analysis of access to federal lands. There is a growing need to understand and mitigate inequities in access to outdoor recreation, especially since outdoor recreation provides critical health and well-being benefits to communities. This proposal aligned closely with our interests, as we both have experience working directly with communities and the environment. Our primary deliverable is to create an interactive platform using the R Package, Shiny. The app will summarize and visualize campground-specific patterns and trends in visitation volume, demand, and visitors’ location of origin.\r\nMajor shout out to Kaitlyn Gaynor and Will Rice for all their support and guidance on our proposal!\r\nOther capstones for the 2022 cohort\r\nAssessing Potential Environmental Justice Implications of Environmental Pressures from the Global Food System\r\nSnow Today: Delivering impactful information on snow cover and albedo to diverse global users through web based big data visualizations\r\nA web‐based application for visualizing spatial and temporal patterns of anthropogenic stressors on coral reefs in the lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia\r\nRenewable Energy Siting Predictors Observed from National Data for Wind and Solar (RESPOND Wind and Solar)\r\nUnderstanding Climate Change’s Impact on the Forest Ecosystem: Developing a Reproducible Machine Learning Approach to Ecohydrologic Model Output\r\nAn open-source pipeline for remote sensing of crop yields under environmental change in Sub-Saharan Africa\r\nTips, thoughts, and recommendations\r\nNow that our proposal has been submitted (and selected!), we’re waiting to begin work in January 2022. While we wait, we’ve taken some time to reflect on the proposal process. There’s a lot we’ve learned and we’ve compiled our most essential thoughts below.\r\nWhy you should write a proposal (even if you think you shouldn’t or can’t)\r\nWe won’t deny that writing a proposal can be a daunting task – it takes time and work! – but we think it’s a worthwhile process. Even if the proposal deadline is two weeks away while you’re reading this, we encourage you to write a proposal! See if these reasons can convince you:\r\nYou will hear this plenty at Bren (if you haven’t already), but networking is a crucial part of your grad school experience. This includes networking with your cohort! Your cohort will be some of your strongest connections after you graduate, and working on a capstone proposal is a great opportunity to build those connections early. Beyond your cohort, working on a proposal with a client gives you many excellent opportunities to network with potential employers (or someone who can connect you to potential employers).\r\nThe MEDS program is a professional-degree program and is all about preparing you for a career to solve environmental problems using data science. The capstone proposal is one of the first opportunities use what you’re learning! It’s a moment to practice several professional skills like project management, communication, research, proposal writing and data exploration. This means this is a real-life experience that you can put on your resume. We found this to be crucial for us since our backgrounds include less technical data experiences and we want to be able to graduate with both a degree and relevant experience.\r\nOur primary motivation to write a capstone proposal was because we care about the topic. We deeply care about environmental justice, and while we aren’t 100% sure what this looks like for our data science futures, we know we want careers that involve people and how they interact with the environment. So when we saw a proposal idea focused on studying spatiotemporal patterns of visitors in National Parks we both instantly wanted to know more. Writing a proposal gave us the opportunity to dive into a topic we were interested in. This made writing the proposal less of a daunting task since we were internally motivated. It also meant that we were more willing to challenge ourselves because we personally care about the outcome of the proposal.\r\nMost Helpful Resources\r\nEach other! After the first few weeks of summer, you and your cohort will have already spent at least 40 hrs a week with each other. Meaning - there’s a good chance you’ll have at least a basic understanding of everyone’s interests (also you may not have an interest yet, or maybe your interests are only vague ideas - that’s okay!). Anyway, what we are trying to say is find who in your cohort has similar interests to you! Because writing a proposal together makes the whole task less daunting. This allows you to split up the work, lean on each other for support, and discuss when you feel uncertain (which we did a lot!).\r\nWe approached our client the second week of the summer and started brainstorming ideas soon after. By starting early, this gave us time to really sit with the information, the data, and the overall question we wanted to answer. When it comes to writing a proposal, time to sit and reflect about your proposal idea is part of the process.\r\nNot sure where to start your research? Have too many topics you’re interested in? Talk to a librarian! Each department at UCSB has their own dedicated librarian. Check out the Subject Guides webpage on the library’s website for resources and contact information to subject experts. You might also want to check out the Zoetro Workshop so you can start organizing your background research right away.\r\nSomething else you’ve probably heard is don’t reinvent the wheel. Many functions and solutions you need already exist thanks to the many amazing and talented individuals within the data science field. The same goes for project proposals. If you’re getting writer’s block look at the Master’s Project Directory on the Bren website to see proposals from previous years for inspiration (Bren students have been doing capstone projects since 1999!).\r\nIf you haven’t written in awhile…talk to professors or students in the Communications Focus! They know how important writing skills are and want you to succeed. Some helpful readings to check out are:\r\nOn the Art of Writing Proposals by Adam Pzreworski and Frank Salomon. This is a pretty quick read - only 9 pages!\r\nResearch Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches by John W. Creswell. Skip to Chapter Two: Review of the Literature.\r\n\r\nThe “hardest” parts of the process\r\nWriting a proposal is doable and we’re all capable of writing one! For us, describing the work before we’ve learned how to do it was the most overwhelming part of the process. But you’re not alone! That’s where the clients for our project came into play. They were able to put into technical terms our ideas and excitement for the project. Don’t be afraid to be upfront with what you don’t know yet.\r\nHow to consider an Environmental Justice lens in your prosposal (and beyond!)\r\nEnvironmental Justice (EJ) has multiple definitions that changes with context. One framework we’d like to share with you is intersectional environmentalism, coined by Leah Thomas. Intersectional enviornmentalism focuses on the interconnections between injustices that harm people (especially frontline communities or those who have been historically discriminated against) and the environment. This is a crucial lens to maintain while you are writing your proposal because the solutions we write about are not solutions unless it works for everyone involved. We have found this lens to be challenging at times because it forces us to think differently and tests assumptions we’ve grown up with, but ultimately it makes use better data scientists.\r\nHere are some EJ themes and questions to think about while writing your proposal. These questions use Justice Analysis to identify environmental injustices and come from Bren’s Equity and the Environment course (highly recommend taking!).\r\nPower\r\nWho has the power in the situation?\r\nWho has privilege?\r\nHow does power and privilege play into communication, representation, access to resources, or decision-making?\r\nDistribution of Harm\r\nWho is receiving the brunt of the suffering or harm in the situation?\r\nAnthropocentrism / Species-ism\r\nWhat aspects of the environment are being systematically overlooked and why?\r\nHow is excessive self-centeredness playing into this -\r\non the part of the humans?\r\nWhat can we do to overcome it?\r\nRacism & Xenophobia\r\nHow is this factoring into the situation?\r\nDoes someone have less power or privilege because of their race or ethnicity?\r\nWays of Knowing\r\nWhose ‘way of knowing’ are privileged?\r\nIs there a type of evidence or data that is privileged over others?\r\nIs the world view of the dominant group causing harm?\r\nExclusionary Solutions\r\nDoes what is offered make sense for all potential parties involved?\r\nIs the solution reasonable and accessible?\r\nBurden of Evidence\r\nWho is responsible for showing there is environmental harm?\r\nIs this appropriate? What would an alternative be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Additionally, both are linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. There is proven evidence that areas with more urban tree canopy have increased public health indicators (6). This includes lower rates of disease such as asthma, strokes, and cardiac disease. There is also evidence that individuals with existing respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease are not only more likely to contract COVID-19, but also more likely to be sicker or even die (8).\r\nData\r\nTree Canopy Data\r\nThe tree canopy data used for this analysis is publicly available from the Public Health Alliance of Southern California (2), which reports California Healthy Places Indexes. The data is available in CSV format, with a canopy cover percentage for each census tract within California. The website was last updated in April of 2021, but the tree canopy data is from 2011.\r\nCOVID-19 Data\r\nThe COVID-19 data used in this analysis was publicly available on the LA Times DataDesk GitHub repository (1). This data was collected using scrapers written in Python and Jupyter notebooks, scheduled and run via GitHub Actions, and archived using git. The scrapers collection data from the California Department of Public Health and other government agencies. This data is at a county-level spatial resolution and includes a daily number for both confirmed cases and deaths from February 1st, 2020 to today. The data used in this analysis included daily numbers from February 1st, 2020 through November 22, 2021. Potential bias in this data, is that confirmed cases are calculated based on positive test results. This means that any individuals who contracted COVID-19, but did not get tested, are not included in this data. Due to the high rate of asymptomatic cases (9), there is likely a large quantity of missing data.\r\nGeographic Data\r\nThe geographic data used in this analysis includes California county borders and U.S. Census regions, which subsets the state into 10 different regions. The county geographies were downloaded as a ShapeFile from the LA Times DataDesk GitHub repository (3). The U.S. Census regions were manually entered into R based on a map publicly available on the U.S. Census website (5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Data Analysis\r\nFor my analysis I planned to conduct a simple OLS linear regression, but first conducted some basic analysis to explore the data. To begin, I needed to transform the tree canopy and COVID-19 data to be at the same spatial and temporal resolution. First, I calculated the tree canopy cover percentage for each county using the group_by() and summarize() functions to create an average from the census tract data. Next, I calculated each county’s average population, average daily number of confirmed positive cases, and average daily reported deaths also using group_by() and summarize() functions. Finally, I calculated a rate of deaths per confirmed case and per capita for each county. Once this was completed, I combined all datasets based on the county Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) codes to create a dataframe including tree canopy, COVID-19, and income data as well as geometries for each county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Data Visualization\r\nBefore deciding to use a simple OLS linear regression, I wanted to conduct some basic data visualization to explore the correlation between tree canopy and the rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive case.\r\nFirst, I aggregated the county data further into the 10 county regions as defined by the U.S. Census and plotted the canopy cover percentages and COVID-19 deaths per capita for each region (Fig 1). This exploration showed a potential relationship between lower canopied regions within California and COVID-19 deaths per capita.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Plot showing the average tree canopy cover percentage and average daily COVID-19 death per capita for each of California’s 10 Census Regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, I honed my exploration more closely in on my research questions: what impact does tree canopy coverage have on the likelihood that someone who contracts COVID-19 will die? To do this I created two maps. One map shows the average tree canopy cover percentage for each county within California (Fig 2). The other map displays the rate of average daily COVID-19 deaths per average daily confirmed positive cases for each county within California (Fig 2). As with my previous exploration this visualization does not show anything conclusively, but does indicate that there is a relationship between California counties with lower tree canopy cover and higher likelihood of death for individuals who contract COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Maps showing the average tree canopy cover percentage and average daily COVID-19 death per capita for each of the 57 California Counties. (Note: the tree canopy cover data used did not include Alpine County, so it was excluded from all analysis.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple Linear Regression\r\nI conducted a simple OLS linear regression to look at the impacts of tree canopy cover percentages on the rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive case. First, I used ggplot to create a scatter plot comparing the tree canopy cover percentage to the rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive case for each of the 57 California counties. Then I used geom_smooth() to plot a simple OLS linear regression of the data. Visually, it appears there is a negative correlation between the two rates (Fig 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Correlation plot of tree canopy percentage compared vs. rate of COVID-19 death per positive case for 57 California Counties, including simple linear regression line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of the OLS regression are shown in figure 4. The results show that there is in fact a negative correlation between tree canopy cover percentage and the rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive cases within California counties. The slope results indicates that for each 1% increase in tree canopy there is a 0.008% decrease in the COVID-19 death rate per positive case. However, the p-value is 0.11 meaning that there is no statistical significance that can be taken from this analysis. Additionally, the R-squared value is 0.05, meaning that only 5% of the variation in the rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive case are explained by average tree canopy cover percentages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Simple Linear Regression Results: Impact of tree canopy cover on rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive case in California\r\n\r\n\r\nIntercept\r\n\r\n\r\nSlope\r\n\r\n\r\nP-value\r\n\r\n\r\nR-Squared\r\n\r\n\r\n0.0130365\r\n\r\n\r\n-0.0000772\r\n\r\n\r\n0.107893\r\n\r\n\r\n0.0463171\r\n\r\n\r\nHypothesis test\r\nBecause of the lack of statistical significance discussed above, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis with the current analysis.\r\nNull hypothesis: In California counties, the tree canopy cover percentage has no impact on the rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive reported case.Alternative hypothesis: In California counties, the tree canopy cover percentage has an impact on the rate of COVID-19 deaths per positive reported case.\r\nConfidence Interval\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI calculated a confidence interval and found that I was 95% confident that the true change in COVID-19 deaths per positive case for each 1% increase in tree canopy cover percentages was withing the range of (-0.000172, 0.000017).\r\nConclusions and Future Analysis\r\nAs discussed above, there is no statistically significant conclusion to be taken from this analysis. However, I believe that future analysis is warranted.\r\nFull United States\r\nThe analysis that I conducted only included 57 observations, one for each California county included in the original tree data. This is a low number of observations, so there may be a different result if analysis were conducted looking at all 3,006 counties within the United States.\r\nMedian Income\r\nOther future analysis would be to include median income in the regression model. Because those with higher median incomes generally live in communities with higher tree canopy cover percentages (7), it is possible that the negative correlation we saw was more not due to tree canopy. For future analysis I would use median income data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service website (4), which has 2019 median income data is aggregated to a county level.\r\nMore Recent Tree Data\r\nLastly, the data used in this analysis was from 2011. While tree canopy cover tends to change slowly, there have been technological advances in the last decade (such as LiDAR) that allow for more accurate tree canopy cover percentage estimates.\r\nReferences\r\nData\r\nLA Times DataDesk, California Coronavirus Scrapers GitHub repository: https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-scrapers\r\nPublic Health Alliance of Southern California’s California Healthy Places Index Report: https://healthyplacesindex.org/data-reports/\r\nLA Times DataDesk, Geographic Boundaries GitHub repository: https://github.com/datadesk/boundaries.latimes.com/blob/master/shapefiles/counties/2012/counties.prj\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service County-level Data Sets: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/\r\nUnited States Census, California Complete Count Office: https://census.ca.gov/regions/\r\nLiterature\r\nAstell-Burt, Thomas, and Xiaoqi Feng. “Urban Green Space, Tree Canopy, and Prevention of Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Diabetes: A Longitudinal Study.” The Lancet Planetary Health 3 (September 1, 2019): S16. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(19)30159-7.\r\nSchwarz, Kirsten, Michail Fragkias, Christopher G.
