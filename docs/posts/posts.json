    "contents": "\nUsing ggplot and geom_point() to Explore Palmer Penguin Data\n\n\n\nHere I used the ggplot geom_point() function to create a scatter plot that compares the flipper lengths (mm) to the body mass (g). I added scale_color_hue(l = 50, c = 65) to make the species indication colors darker. I also added a title and updated labels for the the axis. I was unable to figure out how to change the legend title.\nAs you can see, the flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) are positively correlated in all penguin species.\n\n\n\n",
