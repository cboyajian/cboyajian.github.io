Clarissa is an ISA Certified Arborist with specific experience in urban forestry in Southern California. She studied Urban and Environmental Policy at Occidental College and is currently a master’s candidate of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara.  

She began her urban forestry career in 2016, training volunteers to plan and execute tree planting and care projects within their own neighborhoods. She then managed the environmental services department of a direct service nonprofit where she focused on staff management and unit budgets, wrote successful state grants, and worked with the city and local nonprofits. She hopes to use her data science degree to bring more analysis and technical support to the field of urban forestry.  

As a child, she heard stories of her grandparents’ struggle to save a beloved Ginkgo tree. This was the seed of her interested in the connection between people and place. She aspires to work collaboratively to create equitable connection between people and the built and wild environments.
