Clarissa is an ISA Certified Arborist with a focus on urban forestry nonprofit management in Los Angeles. She studied Urban and Environmental Policy at Occidental College and is currently a part of the inaugural cohort of the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. As a child, she heard stories of her grandparentsâ€™ fight to save a beloved Ginkgo tree; this was the seed of her interest in the connection between people and place. She pivoted her career to urban forestry career in 2016, training volunteers to plan and execute tree planting and care projects within their own communities. She then shifted to managing the environmental services department of a nonprofit, where she focused on staff development and budgets, wrote successful state grants, and expanded partnerships with the city and other local nonprofits. She hopes to use her data science degree and work experience to bring more analysis and technical support to the field of urban forestry. She also aspires to work collaboratively to create equitable connections between people and the developed and wild environments.
