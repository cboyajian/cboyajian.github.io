  Using spatial analysis in R to explore the impacts of the February 2021 Texas storms on the greater Houston metropolitan area. Specifically looking at impacts on residential buildings and if any socioeconomic factors led to a difference in likelihood of impact.

In February 2021, Texas was hit by three major storms, that caused a huge power crisis for residents throughout the state. In this blog, I will use spatial analysis techniques to separate out which residential buildings were impacted by the first two storms based on night light data and if any socioeconomic factors led to a difference in impact.

### Loading and Manipulating Night Light Images for Houston metropolitan area
The images are from NASAâ€™s Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC). Houston sits on the border of two images, so I imported and combined the necessary images for February 7th, 2021 and February 16th, 2021. 

```{r}
read_dnb <- function(file_name) {
  # Reads the "DNB_At_Sensor_Radiance_500m" dataset from a VNP46A1 granule into a STARS object.
  # Then read the sinolsoidal tile x/y positions and adjust the STARS dimensions (extent+delta)

  # The name of the dataset holding the nightlight band in the granule
  dataset_name <- "//HDFEOS/GRIDS/VNP_Grid_DNB/Data_Fields/DNB_At_Sensor_Radiance_500m"

  # From the metadata, we pull out a string containing the horizontal and vertical tile index
  h_string <- gdal_metadata(file_name)[199]
  v_string <- gdal_metadata(file_name)[219]
  
  # We parse the h/v string to pull out the integer number of h and v
  tile_h <- as.integer(str_split(h_string, "=", simplify = TRUE)[[2]])
  tile_v <- as.integer(str_split(v_string, "=", simplify = TRUE)[[2]])

  # From the h/v tile grid position, we get the offset and the extent
  west <- (10 * tile_h) - 180
  north <- 90 - (10 * tile_v)
  east <- west + 10
  south <- north - 10

  # A tile is 10 degrees and has 2400x2400 grid cells
  delta <- 10 / 2400

  # Reading the dataset
  dnb <- read_stars(file_name, sub = dataset_name)

  # Setting the CRS and applying offsets and deltas
  st_crs(dnb) <- st_crs(4326)
  st_dimensions(dnb)$x$delta <- delta
  st_dimensions(dnb)$x$offset <- west
  st_dimensions(dnb)$y$delta <- -delta
  st_dimensions(dnb)$y$offset <- north
  
  return(dnb)
}
```

```{r, results = FALSE}
#read in each tile and give appropriate name
before_light_image1 <- "../../blog_data/spatial_analysis/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.h5"
dnb_before_1 <- read_dnb(file_name = before_light_image1)

before_light_image2 <- "../../blog_data/spatial_analysis/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.h5"
dnb_before_2 <- read_dnb(file_name = before_light_image2)

after_light_image1  <- "../../blog_data/spatial_analysis/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.h5"
dnb_after_1 <- read_dnb(file_name = after_light_image1)

after_light_image2 <- "../../blog_data/spatial_analysis/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.h5"
dnb_after_2 <- read_dnb(file_name = after_light_image2)

#Combine the tiles to create one layer for each day
combined_dnb_before <- st_mosaic(dnb_before_1, dnb_before_2)
combined_dnb_after <- st_mosaic(dnb_after_1, dnb_after_2)

#Remove older data to save memory
rm(dnb_before_1, dnb_before_2, dnb_after_1, dnb_after_2)
```

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=3.5}
plot_combined_before <- plot(combined_dnb_before, main = "2021-02-07 Night Lights")

plot_combined_after <- plot(combined_dnb_after, main = "2021-02-16 Night Lights")
```
