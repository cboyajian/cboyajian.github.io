I am an ISA Certified Arborist living in Southern California. 
Currently I am a masters candidate of environmental data science at the Bren School of Environmental Management and Science at UC Santa Barbara. I love talking about baking, my cross-eyed cat, and how people interact with the built and wild environment.
